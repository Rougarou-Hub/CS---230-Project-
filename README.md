CS - 230 Project Document


The Gaming Room client aimed to create a web application that would allow teams to input their answers based on what they observed, inspired by the 1980s game Win, Lose or Draw. Initially developed as an Android app, the client wanted to expand to a web-based platform to make it more accessible to a broader audience while staying within their budget.

I believe I excelled in understanding the client's vision, particularly their main requirements. Breaking down these requirements into a clear, simple list helped me better understand the scope of the project and focus on the essential aspects during development. While I recognize that my work often needs refinement, I am particularly confident in my ability to analyze the pros and cons of developing for different operating platforms. This step is critical to identifying potential challenges and ensuring the project's success.

Interpreting the user's needs is a priority for me throughout the design process. I consistently ask myself how users will interact with the application and whether the design aligns with their expectations. By adopting a user-first perspective, I can ensure that the application is functional, intuitive, and accessible. Ignoring the user's needs would undermine the purpose of the project, as a complicated or resource-heavy design could deter users and lead to financial losses for the client.

When designing software, I focus on making the project efficient in terms of storage and memory usage. Resource-intensive applications can cause significant issues, so maintaining efficiency is vital. One strategy I rely on is writing pseudocode to organize my thought process and plan the project's structure before coding. Additionally, running unit tests and debugging throughout development is essential to ensure the final product meets quality standards.
